# Hurricane-Tracker
Developed a dynamic Hurricane Tracker application that visualizes the movement of hurricanes across a map using Python's Turtle graphics and data-driven insights from Pandas. The program ingests a dataset of historical hurricane records—including coordinates, dates, wind speeds, and storm categories—and animates each hurricane’s path on a world or regional map.

Each hurricane's movement is displayed in real time, with plotted points color-coded by wind speed or Saffir-Simpson category. The application also computes and displays key storm statistics (e.g., strongest storm, average wind speed) through Pandas. This project blends data processing with visual storytelling, offering an engaging and informative way to explore meteorological data.
